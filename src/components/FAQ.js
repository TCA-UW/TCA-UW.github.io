      question: "What is TCA?",
      answer: "TCA is the University of Washington's premiere student-run technology consultancy. \
              We offer a variety of services tailored at helping companies solve their problems \
              using technologies and help students foster the consulting skills they need to \
              succeed in the industry."
    },
    {
      question: "How can I become a member?",
      answer: "TCA accepts a new cohort every quarter. Check out the 'Join' page for more information!"
    },
    {
      question: "What majors does TCA accept?",
      answer: "While we are affiliated with the Foster School of Business, we hire members \
              across every major! TCA has both a tech team and a business teams, so as long as \
              you're interested in joining onr of these groups, we highly encourage you to apply!"
    },
    {
      question: "What's the difference between TCA and UW's other consulting RSOs?",
      answer: "TCA is completely unique in that we are the only RSO offering tech consulting services on \
              campus. We aim to bridge the gap between business and technology by providing specialized solutions \
              in areas such as software development, data analysis, cloud computing, and more. Unlike other consulting RSOs, \
              TCA focuses exclusively on technology-driven strategies, empowering student-led projects and providing hands-on \
              experience for members working directly with clients."
    },
    {
      question: "Do I need to know how to code in order to become a member?",
      answer: "Not at all! TCA has both a tech team and a business team, so we accept members from both technical \
               and non-technical backgrounds. We only ask that members applying to the tech team have either taken CSE coursework \
               above CSE 122 or have taken and have placed into CSE 123 on the Allen School self-guided 12x placement exam. We will also \
               have regular workshops where we will cove industry-level CS and business concepts including system design, database management, \
               stakeholder analysis, and more!"
    },
    {
      question: "What's the time commitment like for this RSO?",
      answer: "TCA is a big time commitment, and we estimate that members will spend 5-6 hours each week through weekly meetings, \
               client engagements, workshops, and more. That being said, we strive to create a flexible and supportive \
               environment, allowing members to balance their involvement in TCA with their academic and personal \
               commitments. We strongly believe that the networking opportunities, industry experience, and learning opportunities \
               this RSO provides will make the time commitment well worth the effort."
